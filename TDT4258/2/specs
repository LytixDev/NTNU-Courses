fixed:
    32 bit system
    data organized in blocks of 64
    FIFO policy for associative caches


variable:
    cache size: between 128 and 4096 bytes
    Cache mapping: The cache can either be a direct mapped or fully associative cache
    Cache organization: The cache can either be unified or split (see above or lecture slides for more details)

behavior:
Number of accesses to the cache: Just count the total accesses that your cache has handled

Number of hits: Count the number of addresses that were already present when the program accesses that specific location

Hit rate: Relative expression of hits over the total handled instructions


TODO:
assume direct mapped and unified

uint32_t cache_size;
uint32_t block_size = 64;
cache_map_t cache_mapping;
cache_org_t cache_org;

// USE THIS FOR YOUR CACHE STATISTICS
cache_stat_t cache_statistics;
